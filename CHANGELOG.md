# Changelog

All notable changes to TENDRIL are documented here.

## v0.1.0 — initial release

- **remote-agents**: live Herdr workspace console for narrow terminals —
  dynamically generated workspace list with per-agent lifecycle chips,
  numeric attach, new-workspace wizard, project launcher, quick shell,
  host status screen, last-workspace reconnect, full mobile key reference.
- **herdr-notify**: 8-second snapshot watcher pushing `Task complete`
  (`working → idle/done`) and `Input required` (`→ blocked`) transitions to
  ntfy; silent baselining on start and after outages, per-pane dedup.
- **Protocol-verified Herdr client selection**: PATH / mise / versioned
  candidates probed; incompatible clients rejected with reasons.
- **install**: interactive user-local installer (no sudo) with `--dry-run`
  and `--doctor` (read-only system check); optional ntfy configuration with
  generated private topic; optional user-level systemd watcher; Herdr
  `Alt+D` detach binding offered with backup + validation + live reload.
- **uninstall**: removes only package-owned files; keybinding backup
  restore requires explicit confirmation.
- **phone/agent**: Termux launcher — Mosh preferred, SSH fallback,
  connectivity guidance, no hardcoded host/user.
- Docs: Android guide, security model, architecture notes.
